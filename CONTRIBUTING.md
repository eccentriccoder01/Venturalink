## 🚀 How to Make a Pull Request

Follow these steps to contribute by creating a Pull Request (PR):

---

### **1. Fork the Repository**
Click on the **Fork** icon at the top-right corner of this repository to create your own copy.

---

### **2. Clone the Forked Repository**
Use the following command to clone your forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Venturalink.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.
```
   cd Venturalink
```

**4.** Create a new branch:
```
   git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**5.** Make changes in source code.
Edit, enhance, or fix the necessary files as per your contribution.

**6.** Stage your changes and commit

```
   git add .
   git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** Push your local commits to the remote repo.

```
   git push origin YourBranchName
```

**8.** Create a [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)  
       Submit your changes to the main repository for review.

> **Note:** If someone else contributes to the repository, your local fork will not automatically have their changes. To stay up to date, follow the next steps.

---

**9.** Set up a reference (remote) to the original repository to fetch its updates:  
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/eccentriccoder01/Venturalink.git
```
**10.** Check the remotes for this repository.
```
   git remote -v
```

**11.** Fetching from the remote repository will bring in its branches and their respective commits.
```
   git fetch upstream
```

**12.** Make sure that you're on your main branch.
```
   git checkout main
```

**13.** Now that we have fetched the upstream repository, we want to merge its changes into our local branch. This will bring that branch into sync with the upstream, without losing our local changes.
```
   git merge upstream/main
```

## ✅ Tips for a Successful Pull Request
Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- 🧪 Write and Update Tests
   Make sure your changes are properly tested and do not break existing functionality.

- 🎯 Keep Your Changes Focused
   If there are multiple unrelated changes you’d like to make, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
